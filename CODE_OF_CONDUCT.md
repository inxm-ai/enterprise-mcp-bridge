# Code of Conduct

We follow a simple standard: be respectful, inclusive, and constructive.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, education, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards
Positive examples:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward others

Unacceptable behavior:
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement
Report issues privately to the maintainer (see author email in `pyproject.toml`). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

If necessary, maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warnings or temporary/permanent bans from project spaces.

## AI Tooling Usage
AI assistants and code generation tools are welcome aids; contributors remain fully responsible for any content they submit. Expectations:
- Manually review and understand all AI-generated code or prose.
- Do not submit unvetted bulk AI changes that obscure history or intent.
- Avoid including output that appears to copy licensed content incompatible with the project license.
- Clearly indicate in a PR description if significant portions were AI-assisted (> ~30%)â€”transparency builds trust.
- Never fabricate data, benchmarks, or test outcomes.

Abuse (spammy AI dumps, misinformation, plagiarism) may lead to moderation action under this Code.

## Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

## Attribution
This is a lightweight adaptation of the Contributor Covenant (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). You may propose replacing this file with the full text in a future PR.
