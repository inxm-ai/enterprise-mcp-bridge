## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use this in my company?

Yes! You can use, modify, and deploy Enterprise MCP Bridge in your company without restrictions.

### Do I need to open source my modifications?

Only if you **distribute** the software. If you use it internally without distributing to external parties, you don't need to share your modifications.

### Can I offer this as a hosted service?

Yes! Running it as a SaaS/hosted service doesn't require you to open source your modifications (though we encourage it).

### Can I create a proprietary plugin/extension?

If your plugin/extension is truly separate and communicates over defined interfaces (like REST API), it may not need to be GPL. However, if it's tightly coupled, it likely needs to be GPL. Consult a lawyer for specific cases.

### Can I dual-license my contributions?

Contributors retain copyright to their contributions. However, by contributing, you agree to license them under GPL-3.0.
